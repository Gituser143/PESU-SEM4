Description of searchFirstOccurrence
=====================================

Decleration: int searchFirstOccurrence(int arr[], int n, int key)

This function searches for the very first occurence of 'key' passed to it in the array 'arr[]' of size 'n'. The function searches by traversing the array from the beginning to the end, i.e from index 0 to index n-1. It returns the index of the very first occurence of the element key.



Description of searchLastOccurrence
====================================

Decleration: int searchLastOccurrence(int arr[], int n, int key)

This function searches for the very last occurence of 'key' passed to it in the array 'arr[]' of size 'n'. The function searches by traversing the array from the end to the beginning, i.e from index n-1 to index 0. It returns the index of the last occurence of the element key in the array.



Description of numOccurrences
==============================

Decleration: int numOccurrences(int arr[], int n, int key)

This function searches for the number of occurences of 'key' in the array 'arr[]' which has a size of 'n'. It traverses through the array and everytime it encounters the variable with value 'key' a count variable holding the count is incremented by 1. After the traversal, the count variable is returned.
